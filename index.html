      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my website, feel free to look around and click any link. None of the links are malicious or have any ads. Take note tha this website is still under heavy construction so come visit now and tthen to check the progress. I built this website primarily for showcasing my skills so this will be the main theme on this site.</p>
      <p>Allow me take you around and explain what each tab on the navigation bar does. As you might have notice you landed on the home tab which is the one with most information about the site. Next to the the home tab you will see the About tab, here is where i tell you about myself, what i am looking for and give full description of my skills and how i acquired them. </p>
      <p>We shall move on to the portfolio tab, should you be interested in my work as a web developer, you will find all the projects that i have done so far. I will give a detailed explanation of each project right next to it. I will not indulge in the last two as they are self explanotary
